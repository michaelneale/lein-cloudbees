# lein-cloudbees

The cloudbees deployment plugin. Deploy your ring apps to cloudbees PaaS trivially. 
Of course your apps are not trivial, they are a special snowflake. 

Currently uses war based deployment - but could be talked out of it to jetty if enough people nag me.

## Usage

install the plugin in your project:

	:plugins [lein-cloudbees "1.0.3"]

To run: 

Create or cd into a ring based webapp project. 
If you run 
	lein cloudbees
then a list of commands will be provided.

eg: 
	lein cloudbees list-apps -- returns a list of your apps !
	lein cloudbees deploy -- will deploy your app. 

For this to work, you will need cloudbees-api-key, cloudbees-api-secret (both of which you can get from grandcentral.cloudbees.com) and cloudbees-app-id (for example michaelvideo/sudoku2 - accountname/app name)
Use ~(slurp file) to read in your cloudbees credentials - DO NOT PUT THEM DIRECTLY IN project.clj.

If you use the cloudbees SDK - it will read the credentials from ~/.bees/bees.config as normal (bees.api.key and bees.api.secret entries in that file, specifically).

If your application is running in European region, override the default api endpoint by setting the `:cloudbees-api-url` key in the project map. e.g. `:cloudbees-api-url "https://api-eu.cloudbees.com/api"`.
